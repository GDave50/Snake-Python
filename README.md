# Snake
The classic arcade game Snake. The player must control the head of an ever-moving snake and direct it to food so it can grow. If the player runs the snake into itself or runs the snake off the game board, the game is over.

# How to play
Use the arrow keys to control the head of the snake.
The rest of the snake's body follows the head.
Eat red apples to grow.
If you run into yourself or go out of bounds the game is over.
Your score is based on the length of your snake.
